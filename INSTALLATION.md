# Installing Node.js

To use the Vue CLI you need to install Node.js. This is what we'll be using for the back end later.

### For Mac and Linux users

My preferred way to install node is to use
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). This lets you install
multiple versions of node simultaneously, in case different apps need
different versions. I don't usually need this, but I prefer nvm
because it makes it easy for me to always get the latest stable
versions of node and npm. It also installs into my local directory,
rather than polluting the globally installed packages.

**If you are on a Mac, be sure to first do this:**

```
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

To install nvm, visit the [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
web page and copy installation command that uses curl so you can have
the latest version. For example:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Then close your terminal, open a new one, and type:

```
nvm install stable
nvm use stable
```

You'll now be using the latest stable versions of node and npm. You
will need to repeat `nvm use` each time you open a terminal.

### For Windows Users

If you use Windows, you can install Node.js by [directly downloading a package](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installing via package manager on Mac or Linux

If you prefer, you can install using your package manager. I prefer to use nvm,
because it is easier to manage multiple versions and get the latest version installed.

If you have Ubuntu, you can do this:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```

For Mac OS, you could use [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/): [Install Node.js and npm using Homebrew on OS X and macOS](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x).
